Hi, I’m Karen. I spend hours researching how to organize my life so you don’t have to spend the time! I’m on a mission to teach you about being a great parent, household leader, and organizer.

My friends and family kept asking me for advice on how to deal with cranky kids and organize the house, so I started this blog to share it with them and anyone else who needs help. I’ve moved 10 times in the last 10 years, raised my daughter, helped my husband become a sought-after engineering manager, and saved my family ridiculous amounts of time and money. 

I blog about [how to buy the right home](https://kohlifornia.com/how-to-buy-the-right-house/), [how to budget for a rainy day](https://kohlifornia.com/budgeting-for-a-rainy-day/), and how to kick butt at [organizing](https://kohlifornia.com/how-to-declutter-and-organize-kids-schoolwork/) everything.

Are you ready to become an organized expert like me?  Let’s do this.
