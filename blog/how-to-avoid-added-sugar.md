title: How to Avoid Added Sugar
---
If you're like most Americans, you probably consume too much sugar.  How much is too much, you ask?  [T](https://health.gov/dietaryguidelines/2015/guidelines/chapter-1/a-closer-look-inside-healthy-eating-patterns/#other-components)[he Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2015-2020 ](https://health.gov/dietaryguidelines/2015/guidelines/chapter-1/a-closer-look-inside-healthy-eating-patterns/#other-components)recommends no more than 10% of your daily calories come from added sugars.  This comes out to about 50 grams of added sugars (200 calories). Now don't confused this with the naturally occurring sugars in fruits, vegetables, carbohydrates, and dairy.  We're talking about sugar that is _added _to the food you are consuming.

Now if you're like me you're probably quick so ask why these added sugars are so bad?  Sure they are extra calories, but what if I'm eating the right about of calories WITH all these added sugars?  Well science thinks you're doing [unnecessary harm to your body](https://www.forbes.com/sites/quora/2016/11/08/new-studies-show-sugars-impact-on-the-brain-and-the-news-is-not-good/#552d4bdd652d).  Sugar has been shown to cause you to overeat by dulling your overeating sensor, as well as aging your skin.  It also reduces our BDNF factor, which slows our ability to form and learn new memories.   And to top if all off the stuff is [_very addicting._](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/aug/25/is-sugar-really-as-addictive-as-cocaine-scientists-row-over-effect-on-body-and-brain)

Okay, so this might have convinced you to eat less sweets in general, skip dessert here and there.  But here's the thing, sugar is added to so many things you already eat.  And you probably don't even know it's there.  Often times if it's a small enough amount it's not even on the label.  In fact if the serving size is small enough that the sugar is less than .5 gram, they don't have to put in the label.  Yes, you read that right, even though food has sugar they can put a big fat zero next to the sugar line!  There's also the "sugar effect" where food manufacturers add just enough sugar to make you love it, but not enough that it tastes sweet.

So there's sugar in everything, it's negatively effecting your health, and you want to avoid food without it. 

# How to Avoid Added Sugar

Avoiding added sugar is actually easier than you might think.  The hardest part will be parting with some of your favorite foods, and purging things from your cabinet.  

**Read every single label.**  Take 30 seconds to turn the item around and look at the ingredient list and then the dietary label.  It might say 0g of sugar per serving, but you might find sugar in that long (or short) list of ingredients. Depending how much of that item you eat, will depend if the sugar is being eating in excess.  For example some mayonnaise has added sugar, but you only use 1 serving every few days.  That's a judgement call, but now you know that every sandwich you eat has added sugar from mayonnaise.

**Eat more fresh fruit.  **It won't be easy, you'll have withdrawals. But fruit is one of the best ways to satisfy a sweet tooth.  It's pretty impossible to eat too much naturally occurring fruit (i'm sure it's been done though).  You'll find that as you eat less added sugar fruit will taste much sweeter.  Try to avoid eating dried fruits.  When fruit is dried you remove all the fiber and water which causes you to eat way more sugar per serving.

**Learn the common offenders.  **Over time you'll just know what foods have TONS of added sugar. Ketchup is one of the worst.  One tablespoon of ketchup contains one teaspoon of sugar.  Just go pull out a tablespoon and a teaspoon for the visual, it's insane.  Cereals, granola bars, flavored yogurts, canned soup, bread, peanut butter, and jam are just a few.  (Side note: if anyone has a great jam that isn't loaded with sugar, let me know!)

**Have a treat. **Don't expect yourself to be perfect; you won't be.  For me it's some delicious dark chocolate in our pantry.  My go-to for when I'm craving something sweet.

**Be flexible. **We all go out to eat, eat with friends, go to parties. You won't know the ingredient list for everything.  Don't beat yourself up about it, enjoy the meal.  Knowing that you avoid added sugar the other 99% of the time is where the real health benefits come from.

_What are some food items you were shocked contained so much sugar?_
