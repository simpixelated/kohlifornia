title: 3 Easy Ways to Increase Your Paycheck
---
If you're like me, you love when there's a little extra money in a paycheck.  I'm quick to pull up the pay stub and evaluate what happened.  When the new tax laws for 2018 went into effect I saw a small increase in our take home pay, but it had me questioning how else I could increase our net pay.  And I mean increase without a pay raise.  Obviously a raise is the best way to get a paycheck increase. :)

# Check your Withholdings (Federal and State)

For a few years I've kept my eye on paycheck withholdings from the federal and state.  It started back in 2015 when we were getting back over $4,000 in tax returns.  While that is an awesome bonus in the first quarter of the year, that money didn't just appear out of thin air.  In fact, I had basically been giving the government a loan. They were just returning it back, without interest.

If you're like me, the [w4 calculator](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/irs-withholding-calculator) provided by the IRS can seem confusing.  It asks a lot of questions, some for which I didn't even know the answer.  So I thought to myself, there has to be a better way to figure this out.  And there is! 

Look at last year's tax return and see how much you owed in taxes vs. how much you paid in taxes.  Say you make $180,000 (as a married couple filing jointly) and you overpaid by $1000.  That's $83 a month.  Now I found this awesome [tool from Turbotax ](https://turbotax.intuit.com/tax-tips/tax-refund/fatten-your-paycheck-and-still-get-a-tax-refund/L5HaySdDP)(note this was last updated in 2017) that shows you how many extra withholdings that equates. In the above example the Turbotax Table says that is equal to one withholding.  Therefore if you are currently taking 3 withholdings (and you did last year), then you should go ahead and take 4 for the rest of the year.  In some instances if it's late enough in the year you could take 5, because you've already overpaid your taxes by quite a lot.

Say that seems daunting.  Here's another way.  Look at that same tax return and see what you owed for the year.  Divide that by the number of paychecks you get and see how that amount compares to what your last paycheck states.  Then go up or down depending on if you are having too much or too little withheld.

I recommend repeating this process every couple of months to double check yourself.  It's not foolproof, but it'll help bring in a little extra cash every month.

# Give Your Health Insurance a Check-up

How often do you really use your health insurance?  How much are you paying out of pocket?  How much do you pay per paycheck for that insurance?  All good questions to ask yourself.  If you're young and healthy you probably don't need the highest, best insurance plan your employer is offering.

When Jordan switched jobs we found the similar insurance to what we had before was going to cost us $300 more per _month_.  I thought to myself, there has to be a better way.  And that didn't include the $150 a month for dental.  A standard cleaning is $85 in our area. How does that equate for 3 people 2 times a year?

Now we all have excellent dental health and are fairly healthy (minus those dang school illnesses).  But you need to be the judge of your own health.  Is your insurance plan too inclusive for you?  Could you save some of that extra premium money and use it for procedures?  Would a high deductible health plan be better for you?  How about an FSA or HSA?  All _great_ questions to explore.  Unfortunately I don't have a calculator or spreadsheet for this one.

# 401K/IRA Contributions

I hope you're lucky enough to have an employer sponsored retirement plan.  Seems to be hit or miss these days.  If you do, remember this is a pre-tax contribution which is _awesome_ because it brings down your taxable income for the year.  However, it does take money out of your immediate pocket on a monthly basis.  So definitely check on yourself and see if that money is being well invested or if you could better invest it yourself through a Roth IRA.  It might be better for you to get yourself out of debt right now, than to put it towards retirement.

My basic point here is to do another check-up on your retirement contributions.  Make sure you're still making the best decision for yourself.  If you really need that extra cash right now, you can definitely make a change here.  But don't forget to save for retirement when you can!
