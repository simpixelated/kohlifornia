We have 4 credit cards, and use each one strategically to earn over $1000 cash back _every_ year.  We even earn up to 6% back on certain purchases. There's a ton of options out there for credit card rewards, but here are my favorites and how to maximize your cash back.

**Costco Anywhere Visa by Citi**\
If you shop at Costco, then you already know about rewards certificate you get every year. But did you know that by having the Costco Citi credit card, you can earn even _more_ cash back?  You earn **4% **cash back at gas stations, **3% **cash back on restaurants and eligible travel, and an additional **2%** cash back (on top of the member rewards) on everything you buy from Costco.  All this cash back comes in a rewards certificate once a year, redeemable at Costco.

**American Express Blue Cash Preferred Card**\
Unfortunately this card does have an annual fee, however you can easily make that back by earning **6%** on groceries (up to $6,000 per year in purchases), and **3%** cash back at gas stations.  Once you get $100 in rewards you can redeem them for a statement credit or a ton of other great offers.

**Chase Disney Premiere Visa**\
If you frequent Disneyland or Walt Disney World, this is the credit card for you.  You earn **2%** back on all purchases at Disney locations (including the Disney Store), gas stations, grocery stores and restaurants.  As you earn your Disney Dollars you can redeem them at most Disney locations.  This card does have an annual fee.

**Amazon Prime Rewards Card by Chase**\
Being a Prime member is great, but did you know you can earn money back?  This card gives you **5%** back on all Amazon.com purchases and at Whole Foods. You also earn **2%** cash back at gas stations, restaurants, and drug stores.  The rewards are easily applied to your Amazon.com purchases when checking out.

I know the options out there are overwhelming, but these four cards have worked their way into our daily buying habits.  By knowing which card to use for which purchase, you can really maximize your rewards and save yourself lots of money on everyday purchases.
