title: 5 Tips for Removing Screens for Kids
---
It's 2018, how can we NOT have screens everywhere?  Most parents have a cell phone, a tablet, a computer, a tv, a smartwatch, etc.  Sure they're _very_ important to most jobs, helpful in day-to-day life, and offer a plethora of tools for our everyday use.  But, the big question I have for you is, do your kids need to be using screens?  And I'm not talking about sparing use for homework from school, I mean excessive use of screen time.

I won't lie to you and say that they aren't useful gadgets when you need to entertain your children.  For a year of my daughter's life we let her use a tablet and watch _way_ too much TV.  Of course I would go back and do that year differently, but I can't.  What I _can_ do is limit her screen time now.

My first real wake-up call about the harm of screen time came from watching my daughter's meltdowns after being on a screen.  Not just a meltdown because time was up, or the movie was over.  I'm talking meltdowns that persisted for _hours_ after the screen time.  Every little thing made her moody and irritable.

So I started doing my own research, and found mixed opinions from the science world.  Some psychologists and scientist are pretty sure we're all [negatively impacting our brains](http://www.bbc.com/news/health-11500084) by staring at screens, and others think we're fine [as long as we limit ourselves](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/screen-time-is-not-bad-for-children-gttq8zf5m).  With the jury still out on the long and short-term impacts of screens, I decided to go ahead with my own experiment.

My small, personal experiment started by not allowing my daughter on screens for a day at a time.  We told her that her tablet was broken, and said we weren't going to watch tv on those days.  Of course she was upset at first.  Wouldn't you be upset if I took away your screens?  She would also continue to ask about screen time, repeatedly. But I noticed as we continued to add more screen free days in a week, her behavior was much more manageable.  

Gone were the tantrums for hours after we stopped looking at screens.  Her moods were generally happier, and she wasn't always whining and begging for a screen.  Eventually we just stopped letting her have screen time (aside from the occasional tv show or movie).

Now I know what you're thinking, but we are definitely _not_ perfect.  She still watches TV at grandma's house and we usually let her watch a show or movie on the weekends.  However long gone is her tablet.  In fact we literally gave it away, and couldn't be happier.  She doesn't beg to look at my phone, or beg to watch videos on my computer. 

Now I may have made this all sound like an easy process, but it's not.  It's _really_ not.  We still have weeks where she'll beg me after school to watch a show.  But I've held strong and we have a much happier child (and life) because of it.
