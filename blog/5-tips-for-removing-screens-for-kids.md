It's 2018, how can we NOT have screens everywhere?  Most of us have a cell phone, a tablet, a computer, a tv, a smartwatch, etc.  Sure they're _very_ important to most jobs, helpful in day-to-day life, and offer a plethora of tools for our everyday use.  But the big question I have for you is, do your kids need to be using screens?  And I'm not talking about sparing use for homework from school, I mean excessive use of screen time.

I won't lie to you and say that they aren't useful gadgets when you need to entertain your children.  For a year of my daughter's life we let her use a tablet and watch _way_ too much TV.  Of course I would go back and do that year differently, but I can't.  What I _can_ do is limit her screen time now.

My first real wake-up call about the harm of screen time came from watching my daughter's meltdowns after being on a screen.  Not just a meltdown because time was up, or the movie was over.  I'm talking meltdowns that persisted for _hours_ after the screen time.  Every little thing made her moody and irritable.

So I started doing my own research, and found mixed opinions from the science world.  Some psychologists and scientist are pretty sure we're all [negatively impacting our brains](http://www.bbc.com/news/health-11500084) by staring at screens, and others think we're fine [as long as we limit ourselves](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/screen-time-is-not-bad-for-children-gttq8zf5m).  With the jury still out on the long and short-term impacts of screens, I decided to go ahead with my own experiment.

My small, personal experiment started by not allowing my daughter on screens for a day at a time.  We told her that her tablet was broken, and said we weren't going to watch tv on those days.  Of course she was upset at first.  Wouldn't you be upset if I took away your screens?  She would also continue to ask about screen time, repeatedly. But I noticed as we continued to add more screen free days in a week, her behavior was much more manageable.  

Gone were the tantrums for hours after we stopped looking at screens.  Her moods were generally happier, and she wasn't always whining and begging for a screen.  Eventually we just stopped letting her have screen time (aside from the occasional tv show or movie).

Now I know what you're thinking, but we are definitely _not_ perfect.  She still watches TV at grandma's house and we usually let her watch a show or movie on the weekends.  However, long gone is her tablet.  In fact we literally gave it away, and couldn't be happier.  She doesn't beg to look at my phone, or beg to watch videos on my computer. 

Now I may have made this all sound like an easy process, but it's not.  It's _really_ not.  We still have weeks where she'll beg me after school to watch a show.  But I've held strong and we have a much happier child (and life) because of it.

# 5 Tips for Removing Screen Time for Kids

My pain is your gain, here are 5 important tips for making the transition away from screens for your kids.

# Get Rid of Tablets (at least temporarily)

I know, I know. You _love_ yours.  But this isn't forever.  You just need to give them the impression that the tablets are gone.  Whether this takes a week or 8, if you hold strong for long enough they will have created new habits that do not involve a tablet.  Yes this does mean good bye educational apps. But ask yourself, how educational were they?  If you don't agree with this one (I understand), then at least think about severely limiting time on the tablet.  Think less than 30-60 minutes per day.

# Have Screen Rules

Whether this means no screens _ever_, or 10 minutes a day, have set rules regarding screen time.  For us this is no screens during the week, and 2 tv shows or 1 movie on the weekend(Fri-Sun).  Grandma's house is fair game for TV, but she generally gets bored after 2-3 shows.  We don't do tablets, computers or phones at all.  I also strongly recommend writing down the rules for reference.

# Model the Behavior

This one is hardest for me.  I find myself on my phone or computer _a lot_.  However the most useful tip I ever received was to put your phone away.  In a drawer, on a shelf, upstairs, somewhere that it's our of your reach -- and mind.  Turn the volume off and leave it be.  As for computer time, obviously I blog.  I try to do it when my daughter is at school, but if she's home I've explained that it's work.  Work for _her_ can be coloring, math problems, reading a book, etc.  We've just classified "work" differently for parents and kids.

This also applies to TV.  I can't say I am the best model of this, as we do watch a show after she goes to bed.  However I really try to limit myself, and find that after awhile I don't really "crave" TV time.

# Go Outside

Outside in nature, or outside of the home.  Get away from those screens! We packed our schedule with more library trips, park time, and playdates.  As the saying goes out of sight, out of mind.

# Be Strong (and consistent)

Have an iron will about it.  No amount of whining, crying, or screaming will break you down.  You got this!
