title: Address Change Checklist
---
Are you moving again?  Don't forget to change your address -- everywhere!  As someone who has moved 8 times in the last 8 years, I've learned all the places to change your address.  There are lots of sneaky address changes you don't think about.  In fact, I just realized about 6 months ago my Costco membership address was from an apartment I lived in 10 years ago.

Most importantly you need to change your address with the [Post Office](https://www.usps.com/manage/forward.htm).  They will forward your mail for 12 months, the only exception is magazines/periodicals are only forwarded for 60 days.  Of course this won't catch everything, items still slip through to the old address.  That's why I recommend you still update your address everywhere.  I know that sounds daunting, but here's a handy checklist to help you get the job done.  I've left plenty of blank lines, for all the sneaky items I may have forgotten.

Here are a few helpful hints for catching everything, as this exhaustive list might not cover every single thing.  Start noting where you get mail from, as soon as you can.  Try and make a list somewhere, so you know where your mail actually comes from.   And last, but not least, just do a few at a time.  The list may seem long, but if you tackle a couple a day, the list goes pretty quickly.

Good luck with your move!  Like my 10 year old Costco mailing address, what's a sneaky address change you have forgotten?
