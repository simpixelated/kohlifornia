Budget, as in you need a... Okay I know most of us don’t like that word.  Heck, I used to HATE the word.  Or better yet, pretend I didn’t need to hear it.  Thankfully Jordan is a software nerd and turned us on to the most amazing software that has changed our cash flow. YNAB (You Need a Budget) is an application that allows you to not only track all of your spending, but put it into neat categories and track EVERY SINGLE DOLLAR. Yes, every single dollar.  Every dollar you earn is assigned a task.  Whether it’s for craft beer, savings goals, retirement, groceries, toothbrushes, car insurance, you name it.  You just make your own budget category.  The best part is that it forces you to live off of what you HAVE, not what you will EARN.  It prevents you from overspending, if used correctly.



One of my favorite features is setting up categories for “rainy day” funds.  Basically I can save up all the money needed to pay every single bill.  I calculate how much I need when that bill comes due, divide it out into a monthly amount and save that up every single month.  Then when it comes due - BOOM - I already have the money sitting there waiting. I can’t even begin to tell you just how life changing that is.  No more worrying, or overspending on my credit cards.  It works the same for savings, or any other fun thing you want to buy. YNAB makes you earn the money before you spend it.



I recommend this software to you not as a boring task to groan about, but a way to free you from financial worries.  YNAB has given me the ability to not fear bills or financial obligations. Now I just say, I got this.
