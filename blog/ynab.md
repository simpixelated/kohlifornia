title: Budgeting for a Rainy Day

Okay I know most of us don’t like that word budget.  Heck, I used to fear the word.  Or better yet, pretend I didn’t need to hear it.  Thankfully Jordan is a software nerd and turned us on to the most amazing software that has changed our cash flow. [YNAB (You Need a Budget)](https://www.youneedabudget.com/) is an application that allows you to not only track all of your spending, but put it into neat categories and track EVERY SINGLE DOLLAR. Yes, every single dollar.  Every dollar you earn is assigned a task.  Whether it’s for craft beer, savings goals, retirement, groceries, toothbrushes, car insurance, you name it.  You just make your own budget category.  The best part is that it forces you to live off of what you HAVE, not what you will EARN.  It prevents you from overspending, if used correctly.

I recommend this software to you not as a boring task to groan about, but a way to free you from financial worries.  YNAB has given us the ability to not fear bills or financial obligations.  

One of my favorite features is setting up budget categories for rainy day funds.  Basically I can save up all the money needed to pay every single bill.  I calculate how much I need when that bill comes due, divide it out into a monthly amount and save that up every single month.  Then when it comes due - BOOM - I already have the money sitting there waiting.  This includes everything from insurance payments, property taxes, clothing, electronics, vacations, gifts, memberships, charitable donations, and on and on.

I can’t even begin to tell you just how life changing it is to have those rainy day funds.  No more worrying, or overspending on our credit cards. Not only does YNAB makes you earn the money before you spend it, but it helps you be prepared for almost every financial situation life throws your way.
