title: Save Money on These 3 Beauty Routines
---
I like to save money where I can, especially when I feel like I'm over-paying for something.  When I evaluated my budget, I noticed that I was spending a lot on beauty routines that I could be either me simplifying or doing myself.  There's no lack of beauty tutorials, DIY tips, and blogs. 

# Hair

This is a big money pit for most women.  Not only do we get our hair cut, we get it colored.  The biggest way to save money on your hair is to _stop with high maintenance color treatments._  They usually require your hair be touched-up more frequently.  I'm looking at you highlights!  There's a few lower maintenance options like ombre or avoiding the top of your head, but they still cost money.

One easy way to save over the year is to _go longer between haircuts and colors_.  If you stretch every 6 weeks to every 7 weeks, that will save you at least one appointment cost.  Stretch it even longer, and the savings add up.

You can also _do it yourself_ for a lot of hair routines.  I love to use this [Pravana gloss](https://amzn.to/2H4B97U) once a week.  It keeps my hair incredibly shiny and bright.  I also get about 10 uses from one bottle.  I wouldn't recommend complicated color treatments unless you're a tutorial addict, but there's a lot of videos out there if you want to start studying.

I'm a big believer in having a good hair cut done by a professional, so I'm not telling you to stop getting your hair cut.  But _opt for a low maintenance style.  _No bangs, or crazy layers that need to be trimmed up frequently. Of if you do, find a good stylist who does free bang trims.
