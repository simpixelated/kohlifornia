title: Save Money on These 3 Beauty Routines
---
I like to save money where I can, especially when I feel like I'm over-paying for something.  When I evaluated my budget, I noticed that I was spending a lot on beauty routines that I could be either me simplifying or doing myself.  There's no lack of beauty tutorials, DIY tips, and blogs. 

# Hair

This is a big money pit for most women.  Not only do we get our hair cut, we get it colored.  The biggest way to save money on your hair is to _stop with high maintenance color treatments._  They usually require your hair be touched-up more frequently.  I'm looking at you highlights!  There's a few lower maintenance options like ombre or avoiding the top of your head, but they still cost money.

One easy way to save over the year is to _go longer between haircuts and colors_.  If you stretch every 6 weeks to every 7 weeks, that will save you at least one appointment cost.  Stretch it even longer, and the savings add up.

You can also _do it yourself_ for a lot of hair routines.  I love to use this [Pravana gloss](https://amzn.to/2H4B97U) once a week.  It keeps my hair incredibly shiny and bright.  I also get about 10 uses from one bottle.  I wouldn't recommend complicated color treatments unless you're a tutorial addict, but there's a lot of videos out there if you want to start studying.

I'm a big believer in having a good hair cut done by a professional, so I'm not telling you to stop getting your hair cut.  But _opt for a low maintenance style.  _No bangs, or crazy layers that need to be trimmed up frequently. Of if you do, find a good stylist who does free bang trims.

# Make-up

If your'e one to wear a lot of make-up every day, then this will be your hardest place to save money.  I personally only _wear make-up a couple times a week_.  I only need to replace my products once every 3-6 months.

Try using the bare minimum of something, don't go overboard.  And also try to skip something hear or there.  Maybe opt out of eyeliner one day, or mascara another.  I also use a tinted moisturizer, so I don't have to use my foundation every time I want to wear make-up.

There are also some great beauty blogs out there who do dupes for cheaper items from drugstores.

# Nail Care

This is probably the easiest way to cut your beauty costs. _Do your own manicures and pedicures. _Invest in all the equipment you need to do it right, and you'll save yourself TONS of money.

I like to make myself a nice foot bath with epsom salt, a little essential oil, and some bubbles.  Then I use a file for my feel, push back my cuticles, and apply my own polish set.  Pretty easy, and I've gotten better over the years.

As for a manicure, I'm hard on my hands so I don't do them often, but the Insta-Dry Line from Sally Hansen is _the best._  It's usually dry to touch in about 10-15 minutes.  I can do my nails, watch House Hunters, and then go about my day/night.

In the end we can achieve a lot of the same beauty results for less money if we just invest a little time in ourselves and stretch appointments a little further.
