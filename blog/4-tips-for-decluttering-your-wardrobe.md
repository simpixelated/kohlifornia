It didn't take moving into a small house with a 1950's size closet for me to downsize my wardrobe, but it was great validation that I have a clutter-free closet.  Even more validating -- I _share_ that closet with my husband.  It's been a few years, and a few moves, but I've finally decluttered my wardrobe.

The best part about having a small and precise wardrobe is that it also declutters your mind.  I find that I don't spend hours staring into my closet feeling like I have nothing to wear.  Because I do have things to wear, the choices are just very small.  And I also love everything I own.  If I don't love it, I don't own it.

A great book that will help you get into the right mindset is [The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up](https://amzn.to/2LgWo9R). But if you don't have time to read an entire book, I've shared my tips for helping shrink your wardrobe and organize your closet. 

# 4 Tips for Decluttering Your Wardrobe

It's really not that hard, but you need to start with an open mind.  If you can't open your mind to having a small wardrobe, you might as well keep burying yourself under clothing.  Change is good for the soul.

**Let go of the money spent.** Yes you spent money on that shirt, pair of shoes, hat, scarf, etc.  So what?  The money is long gone, I mean _long_ gone.  You're not getting it back.  You've gotten some use out of the item, even if it was only one wear.  So maybe it wasn't the best wardrobe decision you made. So what? Let it go.  We all buy the wrong thing from time to time, it helps us learn our style.

**Only keep what makes you happy.  **I mean truly happy. Do you love wearing that item?  Is it one of those awesome staples that you can trust to do the trick?  You should enjoy wearing all of your clothes, and if you don't like it -- toss it.  If you aren't sure, it's not making you happy.

**Know your lifestyle.**  Do you work from home? In an office? At a gym?  What clothes do you really need?  I personally do not need fancy clothes.  I have a couple of nice dresses and a nice pair of shoes.  When I need to dress up, I'm ready.  However an entire closet of fancy clothes would be a waste of space.  You should have enough clothing for _your _lifestyle -- whatever that may be.  Don't hold on to things you'll never need to wear.

**Purge as you go.**  If a shirt gets ruined, or a pair of shoes is too worn down, toss them.  Don't wait for some big spring clean-up.  If something needs to go, toss it.  I put all mine in a bag in the garage.  When the bag is full I take it to a thrift store.  You could also resell them at a clothing shop.  Whatever you like to do with old clothes.  But do not wait for a magical time, get rid of things when needed.

My parting advice is to not fear letting go. You will probably toss something you might have needed a few months later (think Halloween costume), but you can always buy something again or find it secondhand.  That item wasn't making you happy by taking up space in your closet, and life.  Take a deep breathe and know that your clean, organized closet is worth cutting the chord.
