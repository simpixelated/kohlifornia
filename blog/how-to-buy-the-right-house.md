title: How to Buy the Right House
---
Coastal or bust! That was our motto for finding our first home to buy.  Or townhome, or condo.  We really weren’t being selective.  Then we stepped into a little beach bungalow less than a mile to the ocean, and we were sold. Sure it was old, 1950s old, but that was part of the charm. The very best part was the proximity to the ocean.  We wanted that coastal climate, bikeabilty to the beach, beach town vibe.  Well we got it, and we hated it.

The hardest part for us was admitting defeat.  Swallowing our pride enough to say we were unhappy and made the wrong decision.  As homebodies we view our home as our sanctuary,  We want to be comfortable, and the charm of the older house wasn’t enough to overlook how uncomfortable we were.  We could have either spent $100k on renovations to modernize the house to our standards, or cut our losses and get into a place that had all the things we wanted for the same price.  Yes we are losing our coastal climate, and our big backyard.  But you know what? We are okay with that.  I think we had to make the wrong decision first in order to find out what we really wanted.

Now we're living in a gorgeous townhouse, and we learned a lot about how to buy the right house. In the end, location wasn’t the end all be all we thought it was.  I’m so happy we decided to be honest with ourselves, and didn’t go into a huge amount of debt.  I now happily tell people we bought the wrong house, but now we have the right house and it’s perfect for us.

# How to Buy the Right House

1. **Gauge your patience.**  Can you wait 2-3 years for your house to become your dream home?  Don’t let all those home improvement shows fool you. It takes LOTS of time. money, and patience.  Unfortunately, we are impatient people.  After 9 months we couldn’t stand the thought of living through another year with no insulation, one bathroom, an old kitchen (with no dishwasher or microwave), and no central climate control.  Be honest with yourself, are you patient enough to live with your new home until you can renovate?
2. **Will you actually use the amenities you live near?** We chose the ocean.  Did we ever go to the ocean or take advantage of living so close? No. What we did miss was having parks within walking distance, sidewalks, and walkability to groceries/restaurants/coffee. Think about the lesser known amenities you use on a daily basis, would you miss them?
3. **Are you a homebody or a busy bee who is never home?**  We are homebodies.  We love to be at home in our pajamas.  Because of this it’s important to us that our house be extremely comfortable.  That includes climate control.  We want our house to be the temperature WE choose, not dictated by mother nature.  This also means we’re home all the time.  Three people who are home often, with only one small bathroom, soon find they need a second toilet.  This can also apply to your kitchen, if you often cook at home.  Does someone work from home and need a dedicated office?
4. **What is the ongoing cost of maintaining the home?**  Is the house older? Will things need to be replaced sooner rather than later?  Take the yard into consideration.  Fencing, landscaping, maintaining older trees.  That all costs a lot of money and takes up a lot of your weekend time.  With age also comes building codes from another era.  Electrical, plumbing, and insulation all need to be updated and replaced eventually.  We’re not just talking about costs for adding new things, but maintaining older things as well.  Big trees can cause root problems.  Older electrical will require being updated and replaced to add new appliances. 
5. **Don’t rush yourself.**  We know, we know, this is a sellers market.  As buyers who put in 7 offers before we had one accepted, we get it.  However I look back and ask myself if any of the other houses were right for us. Don’t overpay for something you know you can’t or shouldn’t afford.  Don’t go higher than you’re willing, especially if it feels forced.  If you lose a house, another WILL come along.   

Of course there’s all the runners-up: budget, location, schools, proximity to work, etc.  Hopefully our mistake has provided you a little help with buying the right house.  There’s so many factors to consider when buying a home.
