title: How to Declutter and Organize Kids Schoolwork
---
If your house is like mine, you have a mountain of school papers that come home EVERY. SINGLE. DAY.  Now don't get me wrong, I love knowing what my daughter is doing at school.  I love seeing her art skills progress, her handwriting improve, her math problems get harder.  However, I hate clutter.  For as long as I can remember I don't do clutter.  I don't know if this is an innate personality trait of mine, or a part of my Montessori upbringing.  However, it's done wonders for the decluttering of my life.  And today I'm going to help you declutter and organize all that schoolwork.

# Sort What you Already Have

Yes, this one is going to hurt to read, but you need to tackle the mound you already have.  Set aside some time and sit down with _all_ of it. Sort it into two piles: to toss, to keep.  Toss anything that doesn't represent something your child has learned, is uniquely artistic, or can be used as a reference.  Examples: finished math/language workbooks that are useful for future schoolwork, big and/or unique art projects, nicely written reports/stories, big school projects, science projects, etc.   These are things to KEEP.  You can set those aside.  Now it's time to tackle the toss.  These go into two piles: to photograph, to toss.  You know the things to toss here. I'm talking about doodles, worksheets, things that don't hold any value or meaning.  Everything else you want to take pictures of.  Keep the pictures in a folder on your phone/cloud, or store them in an app like [Artkive](https://www.artkiveapp.com/) (<-- this is what I do).  You should now have a small manageable pile of schoolwork.  You can keep these in a file folder, box, or drawer.

# Have a Dedicated Schoolwork Basket

This doesn't have to literally be a basket, it just needs to be a place where you (or preferrably your kids) put all the incoming school work.  This is where you will repeat the above process of sorting on a weekly or monthly basis. The frequency really depends on how quickly you accrue paper. For me, this is once a month because I only have one kiddo.  She does a lot of artwork at school, but it still takes about a month for our [IKEA Trofast storage box](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/80089239/) to overflow.

# Display Right Away

This is probably something you already do, but have a place or way to display that amazing artwork, or hard earned grade.  I've changed mine over the years, but we currently dedicate the side of our fridge to schoolwork.  I've also hung up work on clothespin wires, and displayed in frames.  I found the former to be the best for swapping quickly.

The most important thing to remember is that this artwork might mean a lot to your kid (and you), but it's just a tiny snapshot in their everyday life.  In a year will they remember doing that spelling worksheet?  Definitely not.  The benefit of taking all those photos is that you _can_ go back and revisit them if you need to.  However they're not taking up unwanted space in your house.  Cluttering both your closet, and your mind.
