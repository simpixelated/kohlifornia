title: Living with a Large Mortgage Payment
---
Living in California is expensive, especially living in one of the 10 [most expensive cities](https://www.kiplinger.com/slideshow/real-estate/T006-S001-most-expensive-u-s-cities-to-live-in-2018/index.html) in the country.  So expensive that our mortgage [PITI](https://www.lendingtree.com/home/mortgage/piti/) is about 45% of our net income.  The age old advice is generally no more than 30% of your take home pay should go towards housing.  Unfortunately where we live that isn't a possibility for most, especially if you want to own instead of rent.  

It's also nearly impossible to save up 20% down for your first home, when that requires you have about $80-$140k depending on the size of your starter home. This means you will be paying a PMI (mortgage insurance) as part of your PITI.  Which only adds to your monthly mortgage payment.

But is it possible to live a normal life and still have a large mortgage payment? Absolutely!

# Budget

I'm a big believer in [tracking every single dollar](https://kohlifornia.com/budgeting-for-a-rainy-day/) you spend, as well as giving every single dollar a job. I use [YNAB](https://www.youneedabudget.com/) to track our spending in numerous categories.  This is only about half of them.

As you can see I track where every single dollar goes of our net income.  I have consolidated a few categories.  But I used to have "sustenance" broken into alcohol, coffee, groceries, and toiletries.  This way I know exactly how much I'm spending on everything.

The software also allows you to look ahead to future months, and play around with how much money you spend on various things.  I wouldn't leave them pre-filled, but you can get a better understanding of how much money you have for savings, fun, etc after your bills are paid.

# **Buy Used**

This is one of those obvious headlines, but it's always worth a mention.  Try and buy used when you can.  With Craigslist, Facebook Marketplace, Nextdoor, Fiverr, etc you have no excuse for not finding gently used items.  This is where I recommend setting up a rainy-day savings category so you aren't spending more than you have.

# Prioritize 

This one is personal because I don't know what is important to you.  Maybe it's travel.  Save money every month for traveling.  But you probably can't have a new kitchen table and travel.  Only you know which one brings you more happiness. 

Is education important?  It was important to us that our daughter attend Montessori school for preschool. We had to sacrifice in other areas, but we were able to afford it by prioritizing this over traveling.

# Make Cuts

Cut out the things in your life you don't need.  Maybe your child doesn't need piano, dance, and soccer.  Choose one.  Get rid of cable/sattelite, downgrade your internet speed.

We saved ourselves a lot of money by [becoming a one car family](https://kohlifornia.com/3-tips-for-living-the-one-car-life/). Here's [5 easy ways](https://kohlifornia.com/5-stupidly-easy-ways-to-save-100-a-month/) to save yourself money every month by cutting out underused subscriptions, downgrading car insurance, visiting the library regularly, and adjusting your paycheck withholdings.  Avoid habitual and impulse buys.

# **Make Sacrifices**

Also remember that choosing to own a home means you might have to sacrifice in other areas, like making coffee at home during the week or taking your lunch most days. Don't deprive yourself entirely, but make manageable changes so that you can afford your new home.

# Be Grateful

Remember to be grateful for this beautiful home that is all _yours_.  You no longer pay rent to someone else. You can make the changes you want to the inside/outside, customize it to be your dream home.  Also, you are building up equity so that you can eventually afford more and pay down your mortgage.

You did it, you bought a house!  You might be living a little more stretched than your ideal, but having a large mortgage payment can be affordable and manageable.  With the right mindset, tools, and life changes you'll be able to live in your own home (even if the mortgage payment is on the higher side).
