Living in California is expensive, especially living in one of the 10 [most expensive cities](https://www.kiplinger.com/slideshow/real-estate/T006-S001-most-expensive-u-s-cities-to-live-in-2018/index.html) in the country.  So expensive that our mortgage [PITI](https://www.lendingtree.com/home/mortgage/piti/) is about 40% of our net income.

Budget

Live Frugally

Make Sacrifices

Be Grateful
