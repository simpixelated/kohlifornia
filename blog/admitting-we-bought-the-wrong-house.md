title: Admitting We Bought the Wrong House
---
Coastal or bust! That was our motto for finding our first home to buy.  Or townhome, or condo.  We really weren’t being selective.  Then we stepped into a little beach bungalow less than a mile to the ocean, and we were sold. Sure it was old, 1950s old, but that was part of the charm.  You can add on to the house, remodel it, make it your own.  The very best part was the proximity to the ocean.  We wanted that coastal climate, bikeabilty to the beach, beach town vibe.  Well we got it, and we hated it.



The hardest part for us was admitting defeat.  Swallowing our pride enough to say we were unhappy and made the wrong decision.  As homebodies we view our home as our sanctuary,  We want to be comfortable, and the charm of the older house wasn’t enough to overlook how uncomfortable we were.  We could have either spent $100k on renovations to modernize the house to our standards, or cut our losses and get into a place that had all the things we wanted for the same price.  Yes we are losing our coastal climate, and our big backyard.  But you know what? We are okay with that.  I think we had to make the wrong decision first in order to find our what we really wanted.



We were able to find ourselves a gorgeous townhouse, albeit farther inland. A lot farther inland.  But we are elated to have 3 modern toilets, a dishwasher, a microwave, central heating and air, a third bedroom/office, 2 car garage, laundry room, and great amenities. We didn’t take advantage of living by the beach, we only went a handful of times.  In the end, location wasn’t the end all be all we thought it was.  I’m so happy we decided to be honest with ourselves, and didn’t go into a huge amount of debt.  I now happily tell people we bought the wrong house, but now we have the right house and it’s perfect for us.
