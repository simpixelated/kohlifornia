title: How to Conquer the After School Transition
---
Your child has been at school all day learning new things and socializing with friends. You’ve been working all day, missing your kid(s).  There you are at pick-up with open arms and a big smile, only to be greeted by a grumpy, sulking, moody child.  So what can you do?  As a mother who has dealt with this since day one of preschool, I have a few tips.  You’re not alone.

1. Have a plan.  The second after we’ve said hello, my daughter always asks me what we’re doing today.  If I don’t have anything planned, she immediately falls apart. Now it doesn’t have to be a planned activity like storytime at the library or a park date.  All it needs to me is something for us to do at home.  A craft, building legos together, or a special snack are great options for us.
2. Connect with them.  As soon as you can, embrace your child.  If hugging isn’t their thing, connect with them on their level.  Make eye contact, show empathy.  My daughter isn’t a huge hugger, but she likes when I get down to her literal height level and discuss out afternoon plans.
3. Play happy music. This is a go-to of mine for moody behavior, but I’ve also found it works great in the car.  Have a song in mind or ask your child their current favorite.  Everyone can enjoy a good car dance on the way home or to the next activity.
4. Food.  One of the biggest reasons kids are moody is because they’re hungry.  We have a rule about finishing our lunchbox before we can have anything else, so I will open up her lunchbox and offer it to her on the way home.  I’m not a big fan of food in the car, but sometimes it’s worth the crumbs to have a happy transition.
5. Be patient.  I saved this one for last because it’s the hardest and most important tip.  I always sit in my car for a few minutes and have a little pep talk with myself.  I remind myself that this isn’t about me.  This is about a difficult transition for her, and my job is to make it as smooth as I can to maintain our happy family balance.



Transitions are harder for some kids than others. The most important to you can do as a parent is realize this is a difficult time and embrace it.  Fighting against the will of a child is an uphill battle I don’t wish on my worst enemy.  Good luck parents, you got this!
