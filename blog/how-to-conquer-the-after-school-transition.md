From day one of preschool pick-up has been an issue for my daughter.  Something about that transition from school to home every afternoon is extremely difficult for her.  Usually I'm greeted by a grumpy, sulking, moody child.  I'm probably not alone out there, but sometimes it feels like it.  After 2 long years of a grumpy preschooler I've learned a few tips and tricks that might be useful for other parents out there.

1. **Have a plan.**  The second after we’ve said hello, my daughter always asks me what we’re doing today.  If I don’t have anything planned, she immediately falls apart. It doesn’t have to be a planned activity like storytime at the library or a park date.  It can be as simple as playing legos at home, coloring pictures, making a special snack, or listening to our favorite podcast. 
2. **Connect with them.**  As soon as you can, embrace your child.  If hugging isn’t their thing, connect with them at their comfort level. Maybe that's a high five, helping carry their lunchbox or backpack. The important thing is to make eye contact and show empathy.  My daughter likes when I get down to her literal height level and discuss our afternoon plans.
3. **Play happy music.** This is a go-to of mine for moody behavior at home, but I’ve also found it works great in the car.  Have a song in mind or ask your child their current favorite.  Everyone can enjoy a good car dance on the way home or to the next activity.
4. **Food.**  They're probably moody because they're hungry.  We have a rule about finishing our lunchbox before we can have anything else, so I will open up her lunchbox and offer it to her on the way home.  I’m not a big fan of food in the car, but sometimes it’s worth the crumbs to have a happy transition.  I also have a back up snack handy in case she did eat her entire lunch.
5. **Be patient.**  I saved this one for last because it’s the _hardest_ and _most important_ tip.  I always sit in my car for a few minutes before pick up and have a little pep talk.  I remind myself that this isn’t about me.  This is about a difficult transition for her, and my job is to make it as smooth as I can to maintain our happy family balance.

Transitions are harder for some kids than others. The sooner you can realize this is a difficult time and tackle it head on, the happier after school pick up can be. Fighting against the will of a child is an uphill battle that I don’t wish on my worst enemy.
