Our journey to a one car family started a little over five years ago when my husband [Jordan](https://simpixelated.com) first started working from home.  As a stay at home mom, I was able to give him a ride or let him use the car for occasional work engagements. Even now that Jordan is working outside of the home and our daughter goes to preschool, we still make the one car family life work for us.  This isn't to say it's always been easy, but we've learned a lot along the way.

# 3 tips for making life work as a one car family.

1. **Be patient and flexible.**  This is the number one thing required to make a one car family life run smoothly.  As the one who does most of the driving, I have to be willing to drive Jordan when he needs a ride.  This includes times when I might have other plans, or want to do something else.  I’ve learned to stop, take a deep breathe, and remember we’re a team.  Sometimes last minute things come up and the car is needed.  I have to just roll with the punches.  So be patient with the situation, and learn to work errands into your car trips.
2. **Learn about ride sharing and public transportation.** We’re fortunate in San Diego to have a good coastal train and trolley system.  Together they help Jordan get to work without the long car commute.  He also uses Uber from time to time when I’m not available to drive him.  Ride sharing also extends to commuting with coworkers and family. Most of the time people are already driving somewhere, and they have room in their car for an extra person or three.  Definitely learn about your local public transportation and check into all ride sharing services available.
3. **Sync your schedules.** This might sound obvious, but I mean literally sync your schedules.  Jordan and I have our Google calendars shared with each other.  This way we know when one of us needs to be somewhere, and for how long.  This includes his work meetings, and any school obligations I might have.  We try to make sure and put anything that would impact our car into the calendars. If writing things down works better for you, then set up a big calendar in your entryway. Whatever you need to do so you know when transportation is needed.

It might seem far-fetched if you’re used to having two vehicles, but over time it does get easier.  To be honest, we enjoy the challenge and the cost savings.  We do not have any car payments, so our ownership costs are low. This allows us to have a nicer home and save more for the future (vacations, savings, retirement, etc).  We also have extra space in our garage, and less cars to keep clean.  Honestly, if we could be a zero car family, we probably would.  For now that has to be a pipe dream for when we live in Copenhagen.
