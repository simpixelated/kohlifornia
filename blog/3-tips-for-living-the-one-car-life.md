This might sound crazy to most of you, but we are a one car family.  In fact we’ve lived this way on and off for about 5 years now.  It started when J first took a job working from home.  He didn’t need a car to get to work anymore, and I am a stay at home mom.  It started out going very smoothly, but it isn’t without it’s bumps in the road.  Along the way we have learned how to make it work, even with J now working outside of the home and our daughter being in full-time school.  Here’s 3 tips for making life work as a one car family.

1. Being patient and flexible.  This is number one thing required to make a one car family life run smoothly.  As the one who does most of the driving, I have to be willing to drive J when he needs a ride.  This includes times when I might have other plans, or need to do something else.  I’ve learned to stop, take a deep breathe, and remember we’re a team.  Sometimes last minute things come up and the car is needed.  I have to just roll with the punches.  So be patient with the situation, and learn to work errands into your car trips.
2. Learn about ride sharing and public transportation. J has found an alternative way to get to work that doesn’t involve having a second car.  We’re fortunate in San Diego to have a good coastal train and trolley system.  Together they help him get to work without the long car commute.  J also uses Uber from time to time when I’m not available for a ride.  Ride sharing also extends to commuting with coworkers and family when we can.  Most of the time people are already driving to a meeting, family dinner, etc.  They have room in their car for an extra person or three.  So really learn about your local public transportation and check into all ride sharing services available.
3. Synch your schedules. This might sound obvious, but I mean literally synch your schedules.  J and I have our Google calendars shared with each other.  This way we know when one of us needs to be somewhere, and for how long.  This includes his work meetings, and any school obligations I might have.  We try to make sure and put anything that would impact our car into the calendars. If writing things down works better for you, then set up a big calendar in your entryway. Whatever you need to do so you know when transportation is needed.

It might seem far-fetched if you’re used to having two vehicles, but over time it does get easier.  To be honest, we enjoy the challenge.  We do not have any car payments, so our cost of owning a car is very low.  This allows us to have a nicer home and save more for the future (vacations, savings, retirement, etc).  We also have extra space in our garage, and less cars to keep clean.  Honestly, if we could be a zero car family, we probably would.  For now that has to be a pipe dream for when we live in Copenhagen.
