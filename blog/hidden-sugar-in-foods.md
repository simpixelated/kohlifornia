title: Hidden Sugar in Foods
---
In my last [blog post](https://kohlifornia.com/how-to-avoid-added-sugar/) about added sugar I mentioned a few of the sneaky foods that contain hidden sugar.  Of course there are the foods with naturally occurring sugars: grains, dairy, fruits, vegetables, and nuts.  These are not _added_ sugars, and it's actually hard to consume too many of them.  What I'm talking about here are the foods where the manufacturers add sugar to make them taste better, and keep you coming back for more.

# Condiments

* Ketchup, bbq sauce, hot sauce, mustard, mayonnaise, relish, pickles
* Salad dressings, marinades, dips
* Nut and seed butters, jam/jelly

# Flavored Dairy (not plain)

* Yogurts
* Cottage cheese
* Milk

# Bread and Crackers

* Sandwich bread, rolls, bagels, biscuits
* Tortillas
* Crackers, croutons, 

# Soups and Sauces

* Pasta sauces, simmer sauces
* Canned/boxed soup

# Protein and Granola Bars

* Cereal, granola
* Granola bars, protein bars, cereal bars

# Packaged Meals

* Frozen dinners
* Pre-made food from the deli counter
* Boxed sides, meals

# Beverages

* Juices, tea, iced coffee

This may seem like an exhaustive list, but I'm sure there's a lot of food out there I've forgotten.  Your best bet is to check _every single_ food label.  Not just the sugars, but the ingredient list.
