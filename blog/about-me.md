Hi, I’m Karen. I have a kid, a husband, a house, and a lot of useful knowledge.  I’m on a mission to teach you a little bit about everything, and how to organize it.  

This little blog started when I realized I was a self-taught woman with a lot of advice to share. I’ve moved 10 times in the last 10 years, raised my daughter, helped my husband become a sought-after engineering manager, and helped us save ridiculous amounts of time and money. 

I blog about how to buy the right home, how to budget for a rainy day, and how to kick butt at organizing everything.

By choosing the frugal route, I usually have to do the labor intensive research when navigating life. And I’ve summarized all that research for you!

Are you ready to become an organized expert like me?  Let’s do this.
